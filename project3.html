MERN STACK IMPLEMENTATION 

create an EC2 instance

ec2.png

to update Ubuntu, run:

sudo apt update

and to upgrade Ubuntu, run:

sudo apt upgrade

sudoaptupdate.png 

to get the location of node.js run: 

curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -

curlnodejs.png

install node.js with the command below ; this command will install both nodejs and npm

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

to verify the node installation, run command below:

node -v

to verify npm installation, run command below:

npm -v

you will create a new directory for your To-Do project; run command below

mkdir Todo

mkdirtodo.png

change the current directory by running the command; cd Todo 

Next is to use the command npm init to initialise the project so that a new file named package.json wil be created

npm init

npminit.png 

run the ls command to confirm that you have package.json 

packagejson.png 

the next thing we will do is to install expressjs and create thr routes directory

express is a framework for node.js. to install express, install using npm

npm install express

installexpress.png 

to also a create a file index.js; run : touch index.js

to install dotenv: run: npm install dotenv

to populate the index.js file; open vim index.js; type the code below into it:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "\*");
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
res.send('Welcome to Express');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`)
});


Notice that port b500 was specified in the code, this will be required in the when we go on the browser

type: node index.js

nodeindexjs.png 

open port 5000 on EC2 security

port5000

open up your browser and try to access your server's public IP followed by port 500

http://<PublicIP-or-PublicDNS>:5000

there are 3 actions that our to-do application needs to be able to do: Create a new task, Display list of all tasks, Delete a completed task

for each task, we need to create routes that will define various endpoints that the to-do app will depend on.

to create routes: mkdir routes

change directory to routes folder by running command; cd routes 

create a file api.js with the command ;

touch api.js

open the file with the command; vim api.js

copy the below code into it

const express = require ('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/todos', (req, res, next) => {

});

router.post('/todos', (req, res, next) => {

});

router.delete('/todos/:id', (req, res, next) => {

})

module.exports = router;

since the app is going to make use of mongodb which is a NoSQL database, we need to create a model.

a model is at the heart of javascript based applications, and it is what makes it interactive

to create a schema and a model, install mongoose which is anode.js package that makes working with mongodb easier

run; npm install mongoose - in the to-do folder - cd .. into todo folder

create a new folder - mkdir models

inside the models folder, create a file and name it todo.js; run command - touch <todo class="js">

Open the file created with vim todo.js then paste the code below in the file:    

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

//create schema for todo
const TodoSchema = new Schema({
action: {
type: String,
required: [true, 'The todo text field is required']
}
})

//create model for todo
const Todo = mongoose.model('todo', TodoSchema);

module.exports = Todo;

Now we need to update our routes from the file api.js in routes directory to make use of the new model.

open api.js with vim api.js and delete the code inside with :%d, paste the code below into it then save and exit.

const express = require ('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Todo = require('../models/todo');

router.get('/todos', (req, res, next) => {

//this will return all the data, exposing only the id and action field to the client
Todo.find({}, 'action')
.then(data => res.json(data))
.catch(next)
});

router.post('/todos', (req, res, next) => {
if(req.body.action){
Todo.create(req.body)
.then(data => res.json(data))
.catch(next)
}else {
res.json({
error: "The input field is empty"
})
}
});

router.delete('/todos/:id', (req, res, next) => {
Todo.findOneAndDelete({"_id": req.params.id})
.then(data => res.json(data))
.catch(next)
})

module.exports = router;

In order to store our data, we require a database. To fulfill this need, we have decided to utilize mLab, a service that offers MongoDB database as a service (DBaaS) solution. mLab will provide us with the necessary infrastructure to store and manage our data effectively.

sign up for MongoDB

mongodb2.png 

Create a file in your Todo directory and name it .env.: touch .env 

open the file: vi .env and populate into it :

DB = 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<network-address>/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

mongodb1.png 

Now we need to update the index.js to reflect the use of .env so that Node.js can connect to the database.

delete the existing content in the file, and update it with the entire code below.

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const routes = require('./routes/api');
const path = require('path');
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

//connect to the database
mongoose.connect(process.env.DB, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
.then(() => console.log(`Database connected successfully`))
.catch(err => console.log(err));

//since mongoose promise is depreciated, we overide it with node's promise
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "\*");
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
next();
});

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.use('/api', routes);

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
console.log(err);
next();
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`)
});

start the server using the command: node index.js; You shall see a message Database connected successfully.

Up until now, we have successfully developed the backend portion of our To-Do application and set up a database. However, we still lack a frontend user interface (UI). To address this, we require ReactJS code to create the desired UI. During the development process, it is crucial to test our code using a RESTful API. Therefore, we will need to utilize an API development client to facilitate this testing.

we installed Postman to test our API

postman1.png 

postman2.png 

open the postman and create aPOST request to the API : http://<PublicIP-or-PublicDNS>:5000/api/todos

You can also create a GET request to your API on: http://<PublicIP-or-PublicDNS>:5000/api/todos    

we will create a new folder in the todo directory called client. run:

npx create-react-app client

there are some dependencies that need to be indtalled.

install concurrently. used to run more than one command simultaneously from the same terminal window

npm install concurrently --save-dev

concurrently.png 

install nodeman. this is used to run and monitor the server

npm install nodemon --save-dev

nodeman.png

In Todo folder open the package.json file, populate it with the code below:

"scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "start-watch": "nodemon index.js",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run start-watch\" \"cd client && npm start\""
    },
    
change directory to client ; cd client. Open the package.json file; vi package.json file 

add the key valuepair in the package.json file;  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000" 

in the todo directory, run: npm run dev

npmrundev.png 

Your app should open and start running on localhost:3000

port3000.png 

to create our react components, from our todo directory, run: cd client; move to src directory, cd src

Inside your src folder create another folder called components, mkdir components, move into the components directory; cd components

Inside components directory create three files Input.js, ListTodo.js and Todo.js, run; touch Input.js ListTodo.js Todo.js

populate Input.js by the code provided

to make use of axios, move to src folder and clients folder by running the command: cd .. 

install axios in the clients folder by running the command; npm install axios

axios.png 

go to the components directory by running, cd src/components
