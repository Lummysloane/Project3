MERN STACK IMPLEMENTATION 

create an EC2 instance

ec2.png

to update Ubuntu, run:

sudo apt update

and to upgrade Ubuntu, run:

sudo apt upgrade

sudoaptupdate.png 

to get the location of node.js run: 

curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -

curlnodejs.png

install node.js with the command below ; this command will install both nodejs and npm

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

to verify the node installation, run command below:

node -v

to verify npm installation, run command below:

npm -v

you will create a new directory for your To-Do project; run command below

mkdir Todo

mkdirtodo.png

change the current directory by running the command; cd Todo 

Next is to use the command npm init to initialise the project so that a new file named package.json wil be created

npm init

npminit.png 

run the ls command to confirm that you have package.json 

packagejson.png 

the next thing we will do is to install expressjs and create thr routes directory

express is a framework for node.js. to install express, install using npm

npm install express

installexpress.png 

to also a create a file index.js; run : touch index.js

to install dotenv: run: npm install dotenv

to populate the index.js file; open vim index.js; type the code below into it:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "\*");
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
res.send('Welcome to Express');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`)
});


Notice that port b500 was specified in the code, this will be required in the when we go on the browser

type: node index.js

nodeindexjs.png 

open port 5000 on EC2 security

port5000

open up your browser and try to access your server's public IP followed by port 500

http://<PublicIP-or-PublicDNS>:5000

there are 3 actions that our to-do application needs to be able to do: Create a new task, Display list of all tasks, Delete a completed task

for each task, we need to create routes that will define various endpoints that the to-do app will depend on.

to create routes: mkdir routes

change directory to routes folder by running command; cd routes 

create a file api.js with the command ;

touch api.js

open the file with the command; vim api.js

copy the below code into it

const express = require ('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/todos', (req, res, next) => {

});

router.post('/todos', (req, res, next) => {

});

router.delete('/todos/:id', (req, res, next) => {

})

module.exports = router;

since the app is going to make use of mongodb which is a NoSQL database, we need to create a model.

a model is at the heart of javascript based applications, and it is what makes it interactive

to create a schema and a model, install mongoose which is anode.js package that makes working with mongodb easier

run; npm install mongoose - in the to-do folder - cd .. into todo folder

create a new folder - mkdir models

inside the models folder, create a file and name it todo.js; run command - touch <todo class="js">

Open the file created with vim todo.js then paste the code below in the file:    

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

//create schema for todo
const TodoSchema = new Schema({
action: {
type: String,
required: [true, 'The todo text field is required']
}
})

//create model for todo
const Todo = mongoose.model('todo', TodoSchema);

module.exports = Todo;
